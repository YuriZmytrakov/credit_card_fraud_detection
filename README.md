# credit_card_fraud_detection
The purpose of this research project is to develop a generalized model that will be preventing fraudulent online transactions, this binary classification model can be implemented into online payment platforms that are used by online retailers, and ultimately help online retailers reduce losses caused by fraudulent activities. Furthermore, this paper will identify what factors contribute to the accuracy and effectiveness of fraud transactions classifier algorithms, and how those algorithms can be optimized to reduce the false positives and false negatives. To detect fraudulent activities, features will be constructed based on domain knowledges of industry experts and based on the best practices in Machine and Deep Learning.
